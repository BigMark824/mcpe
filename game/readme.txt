NOTE: This is only used as the working directory if you
are running from Visual Studio on MS Windows! If not, the
working directory will be the one you ran minecraftcpp from.

So for instance, if I ran it in a situation like

/home/pi/mcpe/game $ ../minecraftcpp

the working directory will be /home/pi/mcpe/game.

If you run it from the shell on windows, the working directory
will be the very one the executable is in.
